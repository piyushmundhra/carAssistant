# Car Assistant

### Project Motivation
The touchscreen hype has recently hit the automotive industry. Many manufacturers are building cars with minimalist designs, features little more than a large touchscreen to manage many controls that traditionally found their place on buttons. This change can greatly increase the user satisfaction with interior design but has its downsides. While many cars offer autonomous and semi-autonomous features, these are not commonly standard. This means that many of the cars on the road will features these large screens but not driver safety aids. Most states have a law banning the use of cell phones while driving, a law that is seen as a bipartisan success (quite rare in the US). This begs the question: If my car's infotainment screen is basically a tablet, how different is that from using my phone?
